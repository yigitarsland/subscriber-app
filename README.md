# Subscriber Management App

A React application designed to view and manage active subscriptions. This project demonstrates a clean, scalable architecture using modern React patterns, strong typing, and centralized state management.

## Features

- **Dashboard View**: Displays a list of active and cancelled subscriptions.
- **Async Data Fetching**: Simulates network latency with a mock API service.
- **State Management**: Handles loading, error, and success states via Redux Toolkit.
- **Interactive UI**: Users can cancel subscriptions (optimistic UI update).
- **Robust Styling**: Component-scoped styling using Styled Components.
- **Unit Testing**: Integrated test suite using Vitest and React Testing Library.
